# Mood-of-the-Nation

IBM wanted a service to help them understand the ‘Happiness’ of various universities with their interactions by analysing the tweets related to IBM and a particular university. IBM therefore wanted to us to create a web application that would include the following features:

-	A map visualisation showing where tweets are coming from
-	A topic word cloud displaying the top 20 words used
-	A geographic word cloud highlighting city and county names mentioned in tweets. 
-	A display showing the average happiness score of a collection of tweets for each university. IBM wanted the webpage to make use of IBM’s Natural Language       Understanding API for this. 

In addition to IBM’s specifications for the website, we added a search bar feature to allow users to search for and analyse any collection of tweets.
